### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Backend / data engineer & partner at [Fiqus](http://fiqus.coop/)  

<!-- ![Fiqus logo](https://fiqus.coop/wp-content/themes/fiqustheme/img/fiquscontacto.png) -->

+15 years of programming experience

I enjoy being part of great teams with a continuous improvement mindset.

What cares the most are goals, tools can be learned âš¡ 


I enjoy "spreading" what I know by coaching team mates, giving talks or whatever that allows it: 

- [Introductory talk about DSE & ML (Spanish)](https://youtu.be/nRu1ecY_R-k)

- [IA2 Show & Tell (English)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U70h97dpGJo&t=1s&ab_channel=FACTTIC)


Infinitely curious and always learning ðŸ¤“

Latest projects:
- [Tales factory](https://github.com/fiqus/tales-factory): an innovative application designed to immerse young minds in the rich tapestry of Argentina's diverse biomes and wildlife through engaging interactive storytelling. Leveraging the OpenAI API, the platform dynamically generates captivating stories for children, allowing them to explore the fascinating world of animals and biomes. Users can customize their experience by selecting specific animals, biomes, and other features to tailor the narratives. Additionally, the application offers the option of audio narration through Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), enhancing the storytelling experience and making it accessible to a broader audience.
- [Whisper transcriptions](https://github.com/mjvallone/whisper_transcriptions): a versatile audio-to-text transcription tool using a Python script, seamlessly integrating Whisper, OpenAI's advanced speech-to-text technology. The solution is empowered by Streamlit for swift and straightforward deployment. This tool serves dual functionality, enabling both bulk audio transcriptions and efficient file-by-file conversions. Its user-friendly interface ensures a quick and intuitive experience for users seeking accurate and reliable text transcriptions from audio sources.
- Worked with [romilanda](https://github.com/romilanda) & [damianmdp](https://github.com/damianmdp) to create an [information extraction tool](https://github.com/RomiLanda/recordar_ia) to [transcribe the journalistic archive](https://desafio-ia-por-la-identidad.fundacionsadosky.org.ar/) of Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo
- Mentoring dev team for [Pipettin project](https://gitlab.com/pipettin-bot/pipettin-grbl)
